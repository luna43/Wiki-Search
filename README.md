# Wiki-Search
This program uses a databse of wikipedia articles and uses Solr to effeciently search the articles, then uses JaavaFX to display the UI.

When I began this project I was planning to create a robust web app that incorporated
traditional UI designs from other search engines to display wikipedia articles in a new and interesting
way. What I wanted to accomplish was an easy to use system for accessing and reading multiple articles
at a time. Throughout the course of executing this project my goal remained the same: I wanted a
platform I could see myself using to quickly research a topic. However, as the project progressed I
shifted my attention to creating an easy to use, lightning fast, and forgiving search engine. Instead of a
robust UI I focused on always returning the right articles and doing so very quickly.
